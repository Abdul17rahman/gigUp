# gigUp

Welcome to gigUp, an online freelancing platform for short time employees. With gigUp, we value the time and efforts of both the employers and employees. Employers don't have to employees more than what they earn nor do employees have to be paid less than they actually earn.

gigUp as well enables employees to multi-task as they're not constrained to one single gig a month, you can apply to as many gigs as u can so long as u will be able to execute them perfectly.
